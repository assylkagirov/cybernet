What's the difference between the NLU system in Rasa and the Policy system in Rasa?
  Rasa's NLU system is responsible for processing the raw text entered by the user and  converting it into machine-readable data
  The policy system in Rasa predicts the next action that the assistant should take based on the entire conversation history

What are the practical differences between rule-based methods and neural methods?
  Rule-based methods are usually simpler and lighter. They are ideal for scenarios where interaction patterns are well known and can be explicitly defined.
  Neural methods allow you to learn from these conversations and adapt to new models, which makes them effective in conducting more complex or diverse conversations.
